### Apollo Interview README

Thank you for interviewing with Apollo! If you're reading this README, chances are that you're in the interview stages. If you aren't, why not consider [applying to work here](https://www.apollo.io/company/careers#open-roles)? It's an awesome place to be.

Before your interview begins, we have a couple of steps to follow:

1. **Clone this repository**: This will be the base of your project.
2. **Install necessary dependencies**: You can do this by running `npm i` or using your desired package manager.
3. **Confirm that the app starts up**: Run the command `npm run dev` and navigate to http://localhost:5173. You should see our logo and a nice message.
4. **Turn off AI-powered code generators**: As much as we love new technology, we'd like to see your code! Please turn off any AI-powered code generators such as Copilot.

This is it! You're all set for the interview. Best of luck!
